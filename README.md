# LISEF_2019

1. Two websites that are very important
2.    https://youtu.be/Q4_M8YTAPDg
3.    https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition

4. Install python (newest plz)
5. The GitHub link is the link to face recognition while the YouTube link is how to get anaconda installed 
6. You will need cmake so follow this video: https://youtu.be/tETup8cmqto
7. You will need anaconda navigator and prompt 
8. Follow youtube video(same as above): https://youtu.be/Q4_M8YTAPDg
9. Then in the same virtual environment, download with these commands 
10. pip install dlib and then pip install face_recognition
11. If those commands do not work (or even the first one "pip install dlib" does not work) follow this youtube vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O58ABPnMoV4&t=96s
      DONT ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE WHOLE THING
        1. here is a quick guide to do
        2. FIRST "pip install cmake", THEN "pip install face_recognition" and FINALLY "pip install                   opencv-python" (ALL in anaconda prompt) 
        3. if still does not work then download Visual Studio Community (2019 is ok) (and follow youtube guide to download specifically individual components like c++ tools for cmake)
12. Now it should be a success, if not check if you have put the cmake path into environmental variables
13. Go to anaconda navigator and click on environments (on left)
14. Click on the right environment
15. Install (by going to uninstalled and searching open cv) open cv 
16. Now you are ready to code but before you load up spyder, select the correct virtual environment (in anaconda navigator) and click (install or launch) spyder
17. There are examples of code on the GitHub page (above)
18. Success yay we are still in the process of making things better but this is a good starting point
